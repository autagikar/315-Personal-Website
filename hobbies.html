    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
        <p>I enjoy playing the guitar in my free time. I love rock and metal music so I have been trying to learn it
            as a pastime. It has definetly been a challenging endeavor with many steep learning curves to climb, but the satisfaction of 
            playing a new song correctly for the first time is one of the best there is.

        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p>I started playing tennis right before the start of high school, but I soon fell in love with it and I played 3 years of High school
            tennis as well as years of tournaments outside of school. Although I dont have the time I once had to dedicate to the sport, I love 
            to play when I get the chance and I love to watch a good match if it is on TV.

        <h2>The Gym</h2>
        <p>I've grown to love the gym because it's become a sanctuary for me this year. I started January when I decided to prioritize my health and fitness. 
            The gym has not only transformed my physical well-being but has also become a source of mental clarity and stress relief, making it an integral part of my daily routine.</p>
